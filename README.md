## Workout Logger

https://a4-sstardellis-git-main-sstardellis-projects.vercel.app/

This app is a workout logger, which helps the user manage and store their progress in the gym. 
The user can add, edit, and delete workouts on the dashboard page.

Since assignment #3, the project has shifted from a Node.js Express project to a Next.js project with React components instead of just HTML as our webpages.
There is no authentication implementation for this project.
